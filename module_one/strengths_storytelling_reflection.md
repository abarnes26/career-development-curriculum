# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

-The SFA identified that my most significant strength is "restoration" or as they describe in the details, problem solving.  This has no doubt played a siginificant role in my time at Turing so far, most notably with debugging.  Getting an error when you're running your tests gives me a feeling similar to loosing a bet... that sweet "all-clear" message that I was looking forward to is replaced by jarbled text 50 lines long telling me that I missed a comma somewhere. On the other side of that is untieing those knots and sorting out problems.  The feeling of achieving a fully functional program with a row of multicolored dots to prove it to you is an incredible feeling.  I often initially feel like I don't deserve it, like somehow the machine is feeling sorry for me and is just trying to be nice.

* Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

* Answer the question: how does your Turing story end? Create a vision for your future and your career transition into being a junior developer.

* After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?
