# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

-The Strength Finder Aassessment identified that my most significant strength is "restoration" or as they describe in the details, problem solving.  This has no doubt played a siginificant role in my time at Turing so far, most notably with debugging.  Getting an error when you're running your tests gives me a feeling similar to loosing a bet... that sweet "all-clear" message that I was looking forward to is replaced by jarbled text 50 lines long telling me that I missed a comma somewhere. On the other side of that is untieing those knots and sorting out problems.  The feeling of achieving a fully functional program with a row of multicolored dots to prove it to you is an incredible feeling.  I often initially feel like I don't deserve it, like somehow the machine is feeling sorry for me and is just trying to be nice.

* Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?

-My time at Turing so far has challenged me to not take my current state of mind at face value.  Meaning that over the course of a week, I will find myself down in the dumps about my current progress or doubting that I'm far enough along to keep up with the rest of the module.  It's been an incredibly valuable practice in stepping outside myself when
things seem to be working against me, overcoming the fear of failure and doubt in myself and pushing forward regardless.
There are many days when studying at Turing feel like hiking a mountain in the dark; you often aren't familiar with your academic surroundings and the end goal feels far away and hard to imagine, but you won't find your way there standing still. It takes clawing forward one step at a time and knowing that each step forward is progress and growth.

* Answer the question: how does your Turing story end? Create a vision for your future and your career transition into being a junior developer.

-I'm looking forward to the character that comes from viscously applying yourself every day. I look to finish my time at Turing with the software development skills necessary to gain meaningful employment, but more importantly having mastered perseverance through difficult and confusing times. After I complete the program, I see myself returning to the renewable energy industry.  My initial plan when I left my last job was to get the necessary training to return to work on their software development team and database management.  My far off sights would have me joining the team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, CO to help develop software for processing and energy and climate data.

* After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?

-When I told my story I think I was selling myself short, as I often do.  I try very hard to come off as an Everyman's man, and one way I tend to try and do that is to downplay my passions and experiences.  My intent is to be relatable and show that I have doubted myself and stumbled forward like everyone does, but there is a part of me that knows that putting emphasis on your humility doesn't inspire people.  The people in my life who have made the biggest impression on me will sometimes express humility, but more often than not they are letting their excitement and passions drive them to inspire others.  When I'm telling my story, it would be much more affective to be confident and allow myself to express passion and try to excite others.
