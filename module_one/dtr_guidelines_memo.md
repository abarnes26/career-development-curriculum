## Alex and Cameron Black Thursday DTR

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

#### What are your learning goals for this project?
learn about ORM. learn how to use waffle.io. learn about self / law of demeter. learn about BigDecimal.
#### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
pair and decide on plan for division. work separately during evenings. pair and compair, resolve conflicts, repeat.
#### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
electronic communication through slack works for regular comminucation. person to person or phone calls work better for more urgent issues.
#### How would you describe your work style?
we both work well on our own, after formulating a plan of action.
#### Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
poor communication between partners, poor compromising in code content. time management.
#### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
well rested, well fed and caffeinated is a good place to start. environment isn't as crucial as long as it isn't silent.
#### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
our only restraints involve getting to sleep before too late.
#### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
clear, open and honest communication is the most imoportant factor. self doubt in own code is probably the biggest obstacle that stops us from giving feedback or offering suggestions.
#### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
alex is good at debugging, srp and refactoring. cameron is good at using logic to solve abstract problems. we are both good with stylization convention and syntax. we both need improvment in test driven development.
#### What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
we will primarily use waffle.io and github.
#### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
collaborate ideas through slack or in person and decide a route to try to solve the issue. next, ask classmates or upper mods. utilize project check-ins.
#### How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
the project will be successful once it can pass every piece in each iteration and has been fully refactored. hard work and clear communication will allow us to achieve this goal.
#### Any additional questions that you would like to add:

#### Project:
Black Thursday
#### Group Member Names:
Alex Barnes and Cameron Johnson
#### Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
to learn about ORM. to learn how to use self and understand the law of demeter.
#### Goals and expectations:
to gain more skills working with large csv files and manipulting the data in them.
#### Team strengths:
alex is good at debugging, srp and refactoring. cameron is good at debugging using logic to solve abstract problems.
#### How to overcome obstacles:
collaborate ideas through slack or in person and decide a route to try to solve the issue. next, ask classmates or upper mods. utilize project check-ins.
#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
we are both available daily. we plan to discuss in school a plan of action and execute accordingly. some days this will involve staying after class to work together at school, other times we will decide what pieces to work on and do our part at home and other times we will meet outside of school and work together.
#### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
we plan on using slack as our primary line of commuinication. we plan on communicating daily and updating plans of action as necessary.
#### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
we plan on improving our skills in ORM and in working in hashes.
#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
cameron will primarily work on testing and debugging code to satisfy the spec harness requirements and alex will primarily focus on satisfying the requirements in the projest spec.
#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
we plan to push to our github branches frequently and to merge our branches once one of us makes significant progress. we will review the code together and decide which piece to keep and which to re work.
#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
we both plan to be honest and up front when giving feedback and to recieve feedback with and open mind.
#### Agenda to discuss project launch:
we plan on finishing iteration zero on the first day and to have completed through iteration three by the end of the weekend. this will set us up to complete iteration four or five in the remaining three days following the weekend.
#### Ideas:
watch the video of jeff starting the project, break project into small pieces and tackle each piece one at a time. push to github often and collaborate ideas frequently to ensure a solid plan of action.
#### Tools:
github, slack and waffle.io will be our main tools for managing this project.
